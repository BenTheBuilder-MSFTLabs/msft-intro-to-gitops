# LAB01: Introduction to Git #

What You Are Doing:<br>
You are creating a new repository on GitHub for your Lab API project directly from your terminal using the GitHub CLI (gh). This eliminates the need to manually create a repo via the web interface and streamlines the process. After all GitOps is all about efficiency.

### LAB01: Create LAB-API repo ###

In LAB01, you will learn how to create and manage a new GitHub repository using the GitHub CLI, authenticate with GitHub using a token stored in CodeSpaces Secrets, and clone the repository to your local development environment. You will also practice navigating directories, using Git commands to clone repositories, and integrating a new repository into your Visual Studio Code workspace. By the end of this lab, your workspace will include two directories: msft-intro-to-gitops and lab-api. These foundational skills will prepare you for managing repositories and collaborating effectively in a GitOps workflow.
